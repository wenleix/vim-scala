The vim-scala plugin forked from https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/tree/master/tool-support/src/vim 

As I would like to use vundle to manage the plugins for vim, thus it requires a clean repository *ONLY* for the vim plugin.

Yet Git doesn't support partial fork/checkout, thus I create this repository, which simply fork the original scala-dist repository and remove all unrelated stuff.

It is cumbersome, and please let me know if there is any better way to do it.
